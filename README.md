This repository has most of the projects I have done either academically at BITS Pilani or personally. Machine Learning, Statistics and Cryptography are the domains of these 
projects.

## Getting Started
Descriptions of each project are given briefly here. For an in-depth description, check the respective directories.
* *Cryptography/Project* : Implementation of homomorphic encryption on simple computations like addition and multiplication. Future work includes implementation of the same in privacy-preserving machine learning.
* *GNN applied for NLP*: Ongoing project to classify companies based on their descriptions using NLP, Knowledge Graphs and GNN.
* *GreenBuildProj*: HI-SEAS Solar Irradiance Prediction using data from NASA Merra satellite.
* *NextLabs*: Web application hosted on Streamlit for finding contrasting app reviews that had positive sentiment but 1-star rating.
* *Notebooks* : Random notebooks that have practice work and prototypes.
* *Predicting prices from scraped web data* : Implemented web-automated scraping in Selenium and XGBoost model to predict Tomato prices in Karnataka.
* *PyGame_Atari_Breakout* : A simple version of the famous Atari game Breakout.
* *Traffic Simulation using Reinforcement Learning* : Simulation of Traffic using SUMo and light switching through Q-learning.
